    "# Q1: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL)\n",
    "\n",
    "# AI: Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines.\n",
    "# Example: Chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT, which can have conversations with humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ML: Machine Learning is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms to learn from data and make predictions.\n",
    "# Example: Spam detection in emails where the system learns from labeled examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "# DL: Deep Learning is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers.\n",
    "# Example: Image recognition systems that can identify objects in pictures.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2: What is supervised learning? List some examples of supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data.\n",
    "# Examples:\n",
    "# 1. Regression: Predicting house prices based on features like size and location.\n",
    "# 2. Classification: Identifying whether an email is spam or not.\n",
    "# 3. Object detection: Detecting objects in images with bounding boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3: What is unsupervised learning? List some examples of unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on unlabeled data.\n",
    "# Examples:\n",
    "# 1. Clustering: Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior.\n",
    "# 2. Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of features in a dataset while retaining important information.\n",
    "# 3. Anomaly Detection: Identifying unusual patterns that do not conform to expected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4: What is the difference between AI, ML, DL, and DS?\n",
    "\n",
    "# AI (Artificial Intelligence): Broad field aiming to create machines that can mimic human intelligence.\n",
    "# ML (Machine Learning): Subfield of AI that focuses on building systems that can learn from data.\n",
    "# DL (Deep Learning): Subfield of ML that uses deep neural networks to model complex patterns in data.\n",
    "# DS (Data Science): Field that uses scientific methods, processes, and algorithms to extract knowledge from data, often involving ML techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5: What are the main differences between supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Supervised Learning: Uses labeled data for training. Example: Email spam classification.\n",
    "# Unsupervised Learning: Uses unlabeled data for training. Example: Customer segmentation.\n",
    "# Semi-Supervised Learning: Uses a mix of labeled and unlabeled data. Example: Improving accuracy when labeled data is scarce.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q6: What is train, test, and validation split? Explain the importance of each term.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Train Set: Data used to train the model.\n",
    "# Test Set: Data used to evaluate the model's performance.\n",
    "# Validation Set: Data used to tune the model's hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Importance:\n",
    "# Train Set: Ensures the model learns patterns in the data.\n",
    "# Test Set: Provides an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance.\n",
    "# Validation Set: Helps in selecting the best model by fine-tuning parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q7: How can unsupervised learning be used in anomaly detection?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Unsupervised learning can identify patterns in data without labels. Anomalies can be detected as data points that deviate significantly from these patterns.\n",
    "# Example: Detecting fraudulent transactions in financial systems by identifying transactions that do not conform to normal behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q8: List down some commonly used supervised learning algorithms and unsupervised learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Supervised Learning Algorithms:\n",
    "# 1. Linear Regression\n",
